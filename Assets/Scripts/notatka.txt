KOMENTARZ Z YT DOT. ZACHOWANIA MROWEK

Markers closer to objectives are stronger so ants have more chances to pick the trail in the right direction.
I had exactly the same problem of "bad circles" to avoid this ants have a limited amount of markers they can drop
(which is recharged when they encounter home or food) so wandering ants have no impact on other after a certain time.
